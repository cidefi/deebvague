# deebvague
the `deebvague` toolkit is a set of tools to aid a user in creating deebies.

## goals
so what if i want gilbert gottfried to read my children bedtime stories? it's not child abuse if they find his voice soothing. it's not like i won't have my cellphone on me when i'm out cheatin'. don't tell my wife about this repo.

## proposed workflow
1. run `getter` (to-be-developed) to extract audio from a youtube video
2. run `splitter` (completed) to split into nice segments
3. start transcription framework (to-be-developed) and get to work
4. model gilby's sweet soothing voice to feed into wavernn
5. traumati--soothe my stepkids.
